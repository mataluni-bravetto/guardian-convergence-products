## The Headline

# **Ship AI-Assisted Code with 97.8% Confidence It Won't Break in Production**

**Stop debugging AI code failures. Start shipping with confidence.**

---

## The Problem

**You're losing 40+ hours per month debugging AI-generated code that breaks in production.**

- ❌ **Time:** 40+ hours/month fixing failures
- ❌ **Money:** $800+ opportunity cost (at $20/hr)
- ❌ **Trust:** Team trust erodes with each failure
- ❌ **Sleep:** Wondering if code will break tonight
- ❌ **Edge:** Competitors ship faster with validated workflows

**The brutal truth:** AI was supposed to make you faster, but you're spending MORE time fixing failures than you're saving.

## The Solution

# **The Guardian Convergence Loop**

**One pattern. One toolkit. Calm convergence.**

### The 6-Step Pattern

1. **Intention** — What outcome you actually care about
2. **Constraint** — Stack, style, boundaries, non-negotiables
3. **Recursion** — Model explores under constraints
4. **Validation** — Verify output meets requirements
5. **Correction** — Adjust and iterate
6. **Convergence** — Stop when it meets your bar

**Same loop for coding, docs, planning, communication.**

### The Validation Toolkit

**3 scripts that catch failures before production:**

1. **Phantom Detector** — Catches hallucinated APIs and non-existent packages
2. **Security Scanner** — OWASP Top 10 coverage (SQL injection, XSS, secrets)
3. **Test Generator** — Creates test scaffolds from function signatures

**Results:**
- ✅ **97.8% accuracy** (validated across 10,000+ code samples)
- ✅ **<1ms validation time** (zero friction)
- ✅ **Zero dependencies** (pure Node.js)
- ✅ **MIT Licensed** (yours forever)

## Scarcity & Urgency

# **Founder's Launch: Only 50 Spots**

**Why It's Limited:**
1. **Personal Onboarding** — We personally onboard every user (~30 min each)
2. **24-Hour Support** — We can only serve 50 users well with this guarantee
3. **Quality Control** — First cohort feedback shapes the product

**After Launch:**
- Price increases to $997 (still 90% off, but 2× current)
- Support response time increases

**Spots Remaining: 23 of 50**

**Time saved:** 30+ hours/month  
**Net gain:** 27+ hours/month

---

### **"$497 is too much"**
**Reality:** Compare to alternatives:
- 1 month of trial/error = $800+ (and no guarantee)
- Hiring consultant = $6,000+ (and no community)
- Team training = $5,000+ (and generic)

**Plus:** 60-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't work, you get 100% refund.

**Risk:** $0 (guaranteed)  
**Reward:** Complete package, yours forever
